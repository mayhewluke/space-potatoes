      <h2>Space Potatoes? Home-cooked wha?</h2>
      <p>
        This game is a (shoddy) remake of the 1979 Atari game "Asteroids". Folks
        like to say that
        <a
          href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/movies/a15063/empire-strikes-back-asteroids-were-potatoes/"
          >asteroids look like potatoes</a
        >
        (in space). And
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rxgER1mkL0&t=2m01s"
          >a game needs a name</a
        >, so since I'm so witty, "Space Potatoes" was born.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what's the deal with "Home-cooked FRP"? FRP stands for "Functional
        Reactive Programming". I'm not going to get into the minutia of that
        here, because that's complicated, but it's basically like taking
        Functional Programming (which is itself a fantastic way to program) and
        adding on the ability to react to events (eg. user input) in an equally
        elegant way. In other words, it's the best damn way to program I've ever
        found.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've used various
        <a href="https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/">Reactive</a> and
        <a href="https://reflex-frp.org">Functional Reactive</a> systems in the
        past, and have normally been satisfied with just knowing how to
        <em>use</em> them, even though <em>how</em> the systems worked was still
        black magic to me. Recently, though, I came across a couple YouTube
        videos that inspired me. One was
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9CSWMxJx84"
          >making a remake of Asteroids in JavaScript</a
        >. I'd never made a game before, or worked with the canvas at all, and
        it seems like a fun way to learn something new - and being a game,
        something more exciting to build than just another web app. The other
        was a series on
        <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrhzvIcii6GN_vruBNu04EVHo0PKixXwE"
          >building a Reactive system from scratch</a
        >. It made the basic building blocks made sense, and inspired me to not
        just try Reactive Programming again, but actually try
        <em>implementing</em> it. To really dig in, get grubby, and figure out
        what's going on under the hood.
      </p>
      <p>
        And thus Space Potatoes was born. The game is obviously very simplistic
        and lacking, because for <em>me</em> the <em>real</em> game was actually
        building the underlying FRP system.

        Feel free to
        <a href="https://github.com/mayhewluke/space-potatoes"
          >check out the source for said system on my Github</a
        >. Being a free-time exploration for the sake of learning and becoming
        stronger professionally, it's obviously not 100% feature-complete or
        production-ready, but it is usable and clean enough to be readable.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 75%">
        One caveat: TypeScript doesn't have great support for type inference
        with functional programming styles, so there are a number of cases where
        the type system (and its shortcomings) make the syntax more unwieldy
        than it should be. Ultimately there's a tradeoff between JS/TS and
        first-class functional programming languages, and as a web developer,
        JS/TS is what I get paid to write in, so it's what made sense to use for
        this exploration. Were we wanting proper, first-class support for this
        style of programming, something like Haskell would probably be a better
        bet in the long-term.
